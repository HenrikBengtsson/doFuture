Package: doFuture
=================

Version: 0.1.3-9000 [2016-06-24]
o ROBUSTNESS: Added package redundancy tests that runs all examples
  of the foreach and the plyr packages using doFuture and all known
  types of futures.  These tests are not package tests and need to
  be run manually, e.g.
  source(system.file("tests-plyr", "examples.R", package="doFuture")).
o ROBUSTNESS: Added package tests validating foreach() and plyr
  on regular as well as future.BatchJobs futures.


Version: 0.1.3 [2016-05-07]
o Added package help page, i.e. help("doFuture").
o REPRODUCIBILITY: Added package tests asserting random number
  generator (RNG) reproducibility using the doRNG package.


Version: 0.1.2 [2016-05-05]
o Now foreach::getDoParWorkers() gives useful information with
  registerDoFuture() in most cases.  In cases where the number of
  workers cannot be inferred easily from future::plan() it will
  default to returning a large number (=99).


Version: 0.1.1 [2016-05-05]
o Now foreach::getDoParName() and foreach::getDoParVersion() gives
  useful information with registerDoFuture().

Version: 0.1.0 [2016-05-04]
o Created.
