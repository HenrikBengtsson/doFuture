Package: doFuture
=================

Version: 0.1.3-9000 [2016-06-24]
o ROBUSTNESS: Added package redundancy tests that runs all examples
  of the 'foreach' and the 'plyr' packages using doFuture and all
  known types of futures.  These tests are not package tests and
  need to be run manually.  The test scripts are available in package
  directory path <- system.file("tests2", package="doFuture") and can
  be run as source(file.path(path, "plyr", "examples.R")).
o ROBUSTNESS: Added package tests validating foreach() on regular as
  well as future.BatchJobs futures.  Same for plyr and BiocParallel
  apply functions.


Version: 0.1.3 [2016-05-07]
o Added package help page, i.e. help("doFuture").
o REPRODUCIBILITY: Added package tests asserting random number
  generator (RNG) reproducibility using the doRNG package.


Version: 0.1.2 [2016-05-05]
o Now foreach::getDoParWorkers() gives useful information with
  registerDoFuture() in most cases.  In cases where the number of
  workers cannot be inferred easily from future::plan() it will
  default to returning a large number (=99).


Version: 0.1.1 [2016-05-05]
o Now foreach::getDoParName() and foreach::getDoParVersion() gives
  useful information with registerDoFuture().

Version: 0.1.0 [2016-05-04]
o Created.
