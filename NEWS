Package: doFuture
=================

Version: 0.12.0-9001 [2021-09-26]

PERFORMANCE:

 * options(doFuture.rng.onMisuse = "ignore") is now a tad faster than before.

MISCELLANEOUS:

 * Moved all internal opt-in package tests that test registerDoFuture() with
   popular packages (e.g. BiocParallel, foreach, plyr, caret, glmnet, NSP, and
   TSP) relying on 'foreach' to a separate 'doFuture.tests.extras' package.
   This reduced the size of the package tarball from 140 kB to 40 kB.
 

Version: 0.12.0 [2021-01-02]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now registerDoFuture() returns the previously set foreach backend, making it
   possible to reset the the foreach backend to the previous settings.

 * Now doFuture recognizes when it is called via the BiocParallel package in
   which case it skips the check whether or not RNG was used by mistake.
 
 * Add option 'doFuture.rng.onMisuse' which can be used to temporarily override
   option 'future.rng.onMisuse' when the doFuture adaptor is running.

 * Add option 'doFuture.workarounds', which can be set by environment variable
   'R_DOFUTURE_WORKAROUNDS' when the package is loaded.

 * Adding "BiocParallel.DoParam.errors" to option 'doFuture.workarounds' will
   prefix RngFutureError messages with "task <index> failed - " in order for
   such errors to be recognized by the BiocParallel DoParam backend.


Version: 0.11.0 [2020-12-11]

NEW FEATURES:

 * foreach() argument '.options.snow = list(preschedule = <logical>)' is now
   acknowledged as a fallback to analogous argument '.options.multicore' -
   two arguments defined by the 'doMC' and the 'doSNOW' packages and also
   used by the 'doParallel' package.  As before, argument '.options.future'
   will always take precedence if 'list(scheduling = <logical>/<numeric>)' or
   'list(chunk.size = <integer>)' is given.

 * Warnings and errors produced when using the RNG without using '%dorng%' of
   the 'doRNG' package are now tailored to the 'doFuture' package.

BUG FIXES:

 * foreach() argument '.noexport' was completely ignored by doFuture.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Removed defunct option 'doFuture.foreach.export' values 'automatic' and
   'automatic-unless-.export'. They were made defunct in doFuture 0.8.2.


Version: 0.10.0 [2020-09-23]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Package now only imports packages 'globals', 'iterators', 'parallel' and
   'utils' - packages that were attached previously.

NEW FEATURES:

 * %dorng% of the doRNG package no longer produces a warning on 'Foreach loop
   had changed the current RNG type: RNG was restored to same type, next state'
   when using the doFuture adapter.
   
DOCUMENTATION:

 * The package help incorrectly mentioned `chunk_size`, which now has been
   corrected to mention `chunk.size`.


Version: 0.9.0 [2020-01-10]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now doFuture sets a label on each future that reflects its name and the
   index of the chunk, e.g. 'doFuture-3'.

 * doFuture will now detect when doRNG is in use allowing underlying futures
   to skip the test of incorrectly generated random numbers - an optional
   validation of parallel RNG that will be added to future (>= 1.16.0).


Version: 0.8.2 [2019-10-29]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Document also .options.future = list(chunk.size = <count>) to foreach().

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Option 'doFuture.foreach.export' values 'automatic-unless-.export' and
   'automatic' are defunct. They have been deprecated since doFuture 0.7.0.

BUG FIXES:

 * Package could set '.Random.seed' to NULL, instead of removing it, which in
   turn would produce a warning on "'.Random.seed' is not an integer vector but
   of type 'NULL', so ignored" when the next random number generated.


Version: 0.8.1 [2019-07-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Standard output and conditions are now relayed as soon as possible.

BUG FIXES:

 * One of the package tests had a _R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_LOGIC2_=true bug. This bug
   did _not_ affect how the package worked or any of its results.
 

Version: 0.8.0 [2019-03-17]

NEW FEATURES:

 * The foreach() argument '.options.future' (a named list) can already be used
   to control whether "chunking" should take place or not, and if so, how much,
   e.g. .options.future = list(scheduling = 2.0)).  As an alternative to
   'scheduling', this can now be specified by 'chunk.size' - the number of
   elements processed per future ("chunk").  In R 3.5.0, the parallel package
   introduced argument 'chunk.size'.

 * Elements can be processed in random order by setting attribute 'ordering'
   of '.options.future' elements 'chunk.size' or 'scheduling', e.g. 
   .options.future = list(chunk.size = structure(TRUE, ordering = "random")).
   This  improve load balancing in cases where there is a correlation
   between processing time and ordering of the elements. Note that the order of
   the returned values is not affected when randomizing the processing order.

 * Passing argument '.options.future = list(stdout = ...)' can be used to
   to control how standard output should be relayed.  See ?future::Future for
   further details.  Analogously, '.options.future = list(conditions = ...)'
   can be used to control how messages and warnings are relayed, if at all.

 * Debug messages are now prepended with a timestamp.
 

Version: 0.7.0 [2019-01-05]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Globals are now searched for also among elements that foreach() iterates
   over, e.g. foreach(f = F, g = G) %dopar% { f() + g() }.
   
NEW FEATURES:

 * The maximum total size of globals allowed (option 'future.globals.maxSize')
   per future ("chunk") is now scaled up by the number of elements processed by
   the future ("chunk") making the protection approximately invariant to the
   amount of chunking done by foreach.
   
 * Added support for option 'doFuture.foreach.export = "manual", which will
   strictly follow argument '.export' of foreach() for identifying global
   variables.  None of the future+globals framework for identifying global
   variables will be used. This is useful for asserting that the '.export'
   argument is correct.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added section on Random Number Generation (RNG) to help("doFuture") and
   updated example("doFuture") with a best-practices RNG example.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * TESTS: The opt-in tests for third-party packages now run their examples
   with example(..., run.dontrun = TRUE) to cover even more use cases.

 * TESTS: Added future.callr to the backend opt-in tested with plyr.

BUG FIXES:

 * If the 'doFuture' package is missing on a worker, an error on
   'length(results) == nbr_of_elements is not TRUE' would be produced.
   Now a more informative error is produced.

 * foreach(..., .export) with '.export' containing "..." would produce an
   error when using globals (<= 0.11.0).

 * foreach() would not relay captured conditions as provided by
   future (>= 0.11.0).

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Previously deprecated option 'doFuture.foreach.nullexport' is defunct.

 * Option 'doFuture.foreach.export' values 'automatic-unless-.export' and
   'automatic' are defunct and will fall back to 'export-and-automatic'.


Version: 0.6.0 [2017-10-17]

NEW FEATURES:

 * doFuture now respects option 'future.globals.resolve' instead of being
   hardcoded to always resolve globals (future.globals.resolve = TRUE).
   This makes doFuture consistent with other future frontends.

 * Added option 'doFuture.foreach.export' making it possible ignore a faulty
   '.export' argument to foreach() and instead rely on the future framework to
   identify globals.  For instance, all examples of caret 6.0-77 works with
   doFuture() and any backend when setting this option to "automatic" (or
   ".export-and-automatic") whereas they will only work on forked backends
   if using ".export" or the default "automatic-unless-.export".  If using
   ".export-and-automatic-with-warning", a warning that lists globals
   potentially missing from the '.export' argument is produced - this is
   helpful for developers writing foreach() code.
   
DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added help("doFuture.options").

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * TESTS: The doFuture package gained more opt-in tests for third-party
   packages across all known future backends.  These tests are not performed
   on the CRAN servers; instead they are performed on Travis CI.  Third-party
   packages that are currently tested are: caret, foreach, glmnet, NMF, plyr,
   and TSP.

 * TESTS: Testing global functions that call themselves recursively.


Version: 0.5.1 [2017-09-11]

RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION:

 * Package now suggests doRNG (>= 1.6.6), which fixes several bugs in
   doRNG (>= 1.6) previously suggested.
   
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * TESTS: Adding tests for globals part of other packages for future.BatchJobs
   and future.batchtools futures because in previous versions of those, such
   globals would not be found because the corresponding package was never
   attached in the worker.
 

Version: 0.5.0 [2017-03-31]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added foreach() option to control whether scheduling ("chunking") should
   take place or not, and if so, how granular it should be.  This is specified
   as foreach(..., .options.future = list(scheduling = <value>)).  With
   scheduling = 1.0 (or equivalently scheduling = TRUE), the the elements
   (iterations) will be split up in equally sized chunks such that each backend
   worker will process exactly one chunk.  With scheduling = Inf (or
   equivalently scheduling = FALSE), chunking is disabled, i.e. each worker
   process exactly one element at the time.  If schedule = 0.0, then a single
   workers processes all elements (and the other workers will not be used).
   If 2.0, then each worker will process two chunks, and so on.  If above
   option is not set, then .options.multicore = list(preschedule = <logical>))
   which is defined by doParallel, is used to mean scheduling = preschedule.
   If that is not set, then scheduling = 1.0 is used by default.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:
	 
 * TESTS: Now the doFuture package tests can be configured to also run the
   the help examples of the foreach and plyr packages with the doFuture
   adapter.  To further increase the coverage of these tests, the plyr example
   code is tweaked on-the-fly to set .parallel = TRUE.  The default is to
   test against all of the future strategies that comes with the future
   package, but it is possible to also test against future.BatchJobs,
   future.batchtools, and so on.  These tests are performed on all possible
   future backends before each release (as well as via continuous integration).

BUG FIXES:

 * Using a nested foreach() call would incorrectly produce an error on
   not being able to locate the iterator variable of the inner-most
   foreach() as a global variable.

 * If a foreach() call would result in an error, the error thrown would
   report on "object 'expr' not found" and not the actually error message.


Version: 0.4.0 [2017-03-13]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * SPEED / LOAD BALANCING: The doFuture %dopar% backend now processes all
   elements in chunks such that each backend worker will process a subset
   of data at once (and only once).  This significantly speeds up
   processing time when iterating over a large number of elements that
   each has short a processing time.
  
GLOBALS:

 * For consistency, globals and packages are now identified the same way
   as they are when using regular futures.
 
SOFTWARE QUALITY:
	 
 * Now the package tests future.batchtools with foreach by itself, in
   combination with plyr (parallel = TRUE) as well as with
   BiocParallel::bplapply() and friends.  Similar tests are already done
   using future.BatchJobs.

 * Added test for foreach::times() %dopar% { ... }.  Especially, it is
   now tested that global variables are properly identified.  Note that
   times() does not allow you to specify neither '.export' nor '.packages'
   so it is not really designed for processing in external R process.
   Having said this, times() does indeed work also in those cases when
   used with doFuture because it internally handles this automatically.

 * ROBUSTNESS: The package redundancy tests (not run by 'R CMD check'; needed
   to be run manually for now) that run 89 plyr examples with the doFuture
   foreach adapter, now forces testing of '.parallel = TRUE' for all plyr
   functions that support that argument.  Each example is run across various
   future strategies, including sequential, multicore, multisession, and
   cluster, as well as batchjobs_local and batchtools_local, if installed.
   See doFuture 0.2.0 notes below for how to run these tests.
   

Version: 0.3.0 [2016-10-27]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now argument '.export' of foreach() is acknowledged such that if
   a character vector of variables names to be exported is specified,
   then those variables and nothing else are exported to future.
   If NULL, then automatic lookup of global variables is used.

BUG FIXES:

 * Nested future strategies were not respected by nested %dopar% calls,
   because doFuture forgot to remind foreach that doFuture should be used
   also deeper down.  Thank you Alex Vorobiev for reporting on this.
   
 
Version: 0.2.1 [2016-09-07]

BUG FIXES:

 * Internal R expression created to attach packages was not fully correct
   (but it still worked).
 
 
Version: 0.2.0 [2016-06-25]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added package redundancy tests that runs all examples
   of the 'foreach' and the 'plyr' packages using doFuture and all
   known types of futures.  These tests are not package tests and
   need to be run manually.  The test scripts are available in package
   directory path <- system.file("tests2", package="doFuture") and can
   be run as source(file.path(path, "plyr", "examples.R")).
   
 * ROBUSTNESS: Added package tests validating foreach() on regular as
   well as future.BatchJobs futures.  Same for plyr and BiocParallel
   apply functions.
 
 
Version: 0.1.3 [2016-05-07]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added package help page, i.e. help("doFuture").

RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION:

 * Added package tests asserting random number generator (RNG)
   reproducibility when using the doRNG package.
 
 
Version: 0.1.2 [2016-05-05]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now foreach::getDoParWorkers() gives useful information with
   registerDoFuture() in most cases.  In cases where the number of
   workers cannot be inferred easily from future::plan() it will
   default to returning a large number (=99).
 
 
Version: 0.1.1 [2016-05-05]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now foreach::getDoParName() and foreach::getDoParVersion() gives
   useful information with registerDoFuture().


Version: 0.1.0 [2016-05-04]

 * Created.
