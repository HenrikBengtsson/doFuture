\usage{
registerDoFuture(globalsAs = "*")

\item{globalsAs}{A character string specifying the method on how globals
are identified in all \code{\link[foreach:foreach]{foreach::foreach()}} calls including nested ones.}

Nothing

\description{
Register the \link{doFuture} parallel adaptor to be used by
the \pkg{foreach} package.
}
\section{Globals and Packages}{

Argument \code{globalsAs} controls how the doFuture adaptor should identify
globals part of the foreach expression.  By specifying the argument when
registering the adaptor, that method of global identification will be
used until the adaptor is re-registered.
An alternative is to use \code{globalsAs = "*"} (default), which will cause
the global-identification method to be decided by option
\option{doFuture.globalsAs} at each call to \code{\link[foreach:foreach]{foreach::foreach()}}.

Below is the set of method that can be used for argument \code{globalsAs}
and option \option{doFuture.globalsAs}:

\describe{
\item{\code{"manual"}}{No automatic identification of globals is done.
Only the \code{\link[foreach:foreach]{foreach::foreach()}} arguments .export\code{and}.noexport` are
used to control what globals are exported.
}

\item{\code{"foreach"}}{Globals are identified by \code{\link[foreach:getexports]{foreach::getexports()}}
while respecting arguments \code{.export} and \code{.noexport}.
}

\item{\code{"future"}}{Globals are identified by the future framework,
or more specifically by \code{\link[future:getGlobalsAndPackages]{future::getGlobalsAndPackages()}},
while respecting arguments \code{.export} and \code{.noexport}.
\emph{Contrary to \code{"foreach"}, this method will also detect additional
packages that need to be exported.}
}

\item{\code{"foreach+future"}}{(default)  Globals are identified by the
\code{"foreach"} and \code{"future"} methods combined.
}
}

By appending suffix \code{"-unless-manual"} to any of the above automated
methods, the automated methods are used unless unless argument \code{.export}
is specified (or is \code{NULL}).
This is a to developers for testing that \code{.export} statements are
correct.

By appending suffix \code{"-with-warning"} to any of the above automated
methods, an informative warning will be produced if argument \code{.export}
is used but it lacks some of the globals that are found through the
automated methods.
This is useful to developers for identifying missing \code{.export} elements.
Note that some of the automatically found globals may be false positives.

_The default \option{doFuture.globalsAs} option and therefore the default
method is \code{"foreach+future-unless-manual"}.

The following aliases are \emph{deprecated}:
\code{".export"} (renamed to \code{"manual"}),
\code{".export-and-automatic"} (renamed to \code{"future"}),
\code{"automatic-unless-.export"} (renamed to \code{"future-unless-manual"}), and
\code{".export-and-automatic-with-warning"} (renamed to \code{"future-with-warning"})
}

\examples{
## Rely on the future framework to identify globals
registerDoFuture(globalsAs = "future")

## Like doParallel, rely on the foreach framework to identify globals
registerDoFuture(globalsAs = "foreach")
